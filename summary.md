# Self Defense Fundamentals

## Introductory Class
Techniques must be drilled and practices to be effective.  There is no way to learn self defense in a 3 hour class.  The hope in this class is to give you a taste of self defense techniques and to encourage your to continue your learning journey.

Some situations are not preventable, no matter what your training, your mindset, or your ability to de-escalate the situation.  All you can do is to try to prepare yourself for the best.

One of the things that we struggled with was whether or not to do any striking techniques in an introductory class.  Someone without training attempting to strike an attacker removes the ability to de-escalate and can lead to a dramatic increase in the violence.  In a life and death situation, though, there are no rules.  Bite, eye gouge, grabbing and twisting genitals are all fair game.  Training these techniques are outside of what we will be teaching in this class, but there are resources available. 

Be careful, though.  Some of the videos illustrating self defense situations and techniques can be very triggering.

## Prevention
- Looking out for one another
The person that helps you get away will not necessarily be the person that you expect.  Sometimes it's a supermodel in an airport.

- De-escalation
Knowing their name.  Addressing them by their name.  Humanizing speech.
 
- Situations Awareness

- Confidence

- Communication
Setting up the ground rules of your interaction.  Discussing consent and expectations.  

## Mindset in a dangerous situation
- Instintial responses including gight, flight, freeze
- Breathing
- Strategic Thinking
- Using your voice

## Martial Arts 1st Day Techniques

- Combat base
- Standing up in base

### Falling Safely
- Back Break Fall

### Breaking Grips
- Standard Wrist Release
- Inverted Wrist Release

### Chokes
- Front cross choke - VIDEO
- Rear naked choke
- 


## Use only after some training or as a last resort
Striking, in general, instantly escalates the situation.  If escalation is unavoidable then what you do has to disable the person.  Bite, eye gouge, grabbing and twisting genitals are all fair game.  Some of these techniques aren't going to do anything but piss off your attacker, so use with caution.  A bite, for example, might be used to help you break a grip, if your techniques aren't working.

This you can learn on your own, but we also recommend extreme caution and question the effectiveness when your aren't well trained
- Groin strikes
- Eye Gouges
- Headbutts
- Joint Locks
