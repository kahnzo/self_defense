# Self Defense Fundamentals

## Introductory Class
Techniques must be drilled and practices to be effective.  There is no way to l#earn self defense in a 3 hour class.  The hope in this class is to give you a taste of self defense techniques and to encourage your to continue your learning journey.

Some situations are not preventable, no matter what your training, your mindset, or your ability to de-escalate the situation.  All you can do is to try to prepare yourself for the best.

One of the things that we struggled with was whether or not to do any striking techniques in an introductory class.  Someone without training attempting to strike an attacker removes the ability to de-escalate and can lead to a dramatic increase in the violence.  In a life and death situation, though, there are no rules.  Bite, eye gouge, grabbing and twisting genitals are all fair game.  Training these techniques are outside of what we will be teaching in this class, but there are resources available. 

Be careful, though.  Some of the videos illustrating self defense situations and techniques can be very triggering.

## Prevention
- Looking out for one another
- De-escalation
- Situations Awareness
- Confidence

## Mindset in a dangerous situation
- Fight, flight, freeze
- Breathing
- Strategic Thinking
- Using your voice

## Martial Arts 1st Day Techniques
If you want to use martial arts for self defense, you will have to drill them.  There is no way to learn these techniques in one class.  Therefore we are limiting this class to a short list of techniques.
- Combat base
- Standing up in base

### Falling Safely
- Back Break Fall

### Breaking Grips
- Standard Wrist Release
- Inverted Wrist Release

### Chokes
- Front cross choke - VIDEO
- Rear naked choke
- 


## Use only after some training or as a last resort
Striking, in general, instantly escalates the situation.  If escalation is unavoidable then what you do has to disable the person.  Bite, eye gouge, grabbing and twisting genitals are all fair game.  Some of these techniques aren't going to do anything but piss off your attacker, so use with caution.  A bite, for example, might be used to help you break a grip, if your techniques aren't working.
