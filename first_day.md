# Self Defense Fundamentals

## Introductory Class
Self defense techniques must be drilled and practiced to be effective.  You will not learn good self defense in a 3 hour class.  We hope to give you a taste of self defense techniques and to encourage your to continue your learning journey.

Some situations are not preventable, no matter what your training, your mindset, or your ability to de-escalate the situation.  All you can do is to try to prepare yourself for the best.

One of the things that we struggled with was whether or not to do any striking techniques in an introductory class.  Someone without training attempting to strike an attacker removes the ability to de-escalate and can lead to a dramatic increase in the violence.  In a life and death situation, though, there are no rules.  Bite, eye gouge, grabbing and twisting genitals are all fair game.  Training these techniques are outside of what we will be teaching in this class, but there are resources available. 

Please be aware that some videos illustrating self defense situations and techniques can be very triggering.

## Prevention
### Look Out for Each Other
  
It's very easy to default the idea that you are the only one that will take care of you. Strangely, the person that ends up helping you in a dangerous situation, is often the person that you least expect.

You will not learn any of the techniques that we teach today without practice. Find a training partner. Practice what we learned today with them regularly. Just watching a video or reviewing the technique will not get it into your muscle memory.

### De-escalation
  
De-escalation can help to prevent the need for self defense. Ultimately, you will have to use your own judgement as to what might effectively de-escalate the situation and also be very aware of when it is not working.  

De-escalate a confrontation can include knowing and calling them by their name. Try to use humanizing speech, like mentioning your family or plans. 
 
### Situational Awareness
  
Having situational awareness is an important preventative skill, but even the most well trained, highest level, self-defense and martial arts practitioners are vulnerable to attacks that they just donâ€™t see coming or the behavior of people that is unexpected.

Be aware of the exits, the nearest location of where people would be expected to be, who might have a professional role as security or management. Be aware of the hours of the business near your location and think about where you would go if you were attacked.

### Confidence
In a dangerous situation, you'd like to avoid reacting in a purely instinctual way; fight, flight, freeze. Have a strategy and mindset to help you get out of that situation. Trust your instincts. Your body will sometimes tell you that you aren't safe before your mind does. If you're wrong, that's ok, at least you're safe.

Confidence in self defense techniques will help you to know when you don't have to use them. Confidence that comes from training:  kicking the butt of someone twice your size is not out of reach for someone with training in a variety of martial arts.  But self defense is not the focus of many marital arts.  Competitions have rules that don't apply in a street fight, or a fight for your life.

Training can give you a false sense of confidence. In the actual situation, it's training, drills, and sparring that will completely change the situation.

### Communication

Setting up the ground rules of your interaction.  Discussing consent and expectations.

## Use only after some training or as a last resort
Striking, in general, instantly escalates the situation.  If escalation is unavoidable then what you do has to disable the person.  Bite, eye gouge, grabbing and twisting genitals are all fair game.  Some of these techniques aren't going to do anything but piss off your attacker, so use with caution.  A bite, for example, might be used to help you break a grip, if your techniques aren't working.

This you can learn on your own, but we also recommend extreme caution and question the effectiveness when your aren't well trained
